<b><p>1:Types of E-Waste:</p>
 Includes old smartphones, laptops, televisions, refrigerators, computers, and other electronic devices.
 Anything that is powered by electricity or batteries can become e-waste once it is no longer in use.</b>

 <i><p>2:Environmental Impact:</p>
 E-waste contains hazardous substances like lead, mercury, cadmium, and brominated flame retardants.
 Improper disposal of e-waste can lead to soil and water contamination, as these toxic materials can leach into the environment.</i>

 <u><p>3:Recycling and Reuse:</p>
 Proper recycling can recover valuable materials such as gold, silver, copper, and rare earth metals.
 Many components can be refurbished and reused, reducing the need for new raw materials.</u>
  <s><p>4:Global Issue:</p>
 E-waste is a global problem, with a large amount being exported from developed countries to developing nations, where it is often processed in unsafe conditions.
  The UN estimates that over 50 million tons of e-waste are generated annually, and this number is expected to rise.</s></p>

<!--writing third equation of motion using superscript and subscript-->
<big>Here's a conceptual "third equation" for e-waste management:</big>
<p>R <sup>2</sup>=P <sup>2</sup>+2aD</p>
<!--applying both sup  and sub-->
<big>Applying subscripts to represent e-waste:</big>
<p>R <sup>2</sup><sub>t</sub> =P <sup>2</sup><sub>t </sub> +2 <sub>t</sub> D <sub>t </sub></p>
